this piece of technology is called an external hard drive. It is a portable device that stores data and can be plugged into a computer through a USB. When purchasing an external hard drive people usually care the most about how much storage it is capable of carrying. An external hard drive is capable of carrying anywhere from 1 TB to 8 TB or higher. In more recent news samsung has recently made a 16 TB external hard drive capable of carrying a "lifetime supply of photos" according to recoverit.com. The creation of the external harddrive is able to replace a flash drive because of its capabilty to hold more storage. This piece of technology has impacted my life for better because I use one for my playstation when I run out of space on my built in hard drive. This makes the playstation able to hold more downloads on it. I believe that external hard drives impacted society in a good way because are now able to carry more data and memory on the go. So instead of having to carry around their computer to show someone their photos, they can just bring the external hard drive with them and plug it into that persons computer. One of the main flaws i do see with external had drives is that most of the time it takes longer to download something onto an external hard drive than onto a disk drive or SSD.
